## Biography of **Brian Knudsen**

### Place of Birth
 
I was born in Pittsburgh in June 1978.  I lived there until I was 8.  It was generally a nice place to live. 

My favorite quote is this from [*Marx*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/index.htm):
> Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. Caussidi√®re for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793 to 1795, the nephew for the uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances of the second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire.
